<p>Based off our experiences and backgrounds, the roles are still to be determined. However we have collectively shared the responsibilities to date. Because of Taishi’s background in Computer Science, he will most likely review most conflicts in github for resolution. </p>

<p>We will assign roles based off of each team member’s skill set and strengths. Some team members have more experience in programming while others have more experience on the management side, however we will also remain flexible in our roles and change if something is not working. Some of the roles we are looking to fill as we use Scrum and Agile as our reference, are the Scrum Master and traditional developer. However, all members are expected to do a series of coding over time. We will also keep track of how the roles change over time as we move throughout this project.</p>

Please plan on using a variant of Scrum.</h3>

<p>We plan on having sprint planning meetings on Thursdays after class. In these meetings we will discuss both past development and choose new stories to build upon for the following week. In addition to the weekly meeting, we also have a GroupMe for constant communication. The week will serve as our “sprint” time as individuals. </p>

<p>We determine meeting times via email or in-class stand up meetings. We largely have complementary schedules and will have no problem exclusively having meetings with everyone present. A time that works for all of us is after our Tuesday and Thursday classes.</p>

<p>We plan on having a weekly sprint planning meeting where we decide on the stories we want to tackle for the upcoming week. Then we will also spend some individual time completing these tasks. Per week we hope to spend around 2 - 5 hours total. </p>

<p>At our meetings, we begin by equally dividing the project work. While we have a varying level of CS skill sets, we are all very interested in learning all involved steps. 
What tools will you be using and for what purposes? Please include here development tools and also organizational tools, e.g. "we're using Google docs for ..."
We will be using GitHub to host our weekly sprint reports and for submitting our updates. Cloud9 and Heroku for publications. In addition to the tutorials, we plan on using the tutorial videos make by Kyle for reference along with Google. We will be using communication tools such as GroupMe and email to remain connected and help team members troubleshoot.</p>

<p>We will most likely need to come to office hours at times. If we come, we will be coming to the Tuesday or Thursday morning sessions with Kyle Jensen. If we plan on coming as a group, we will be sure to send an email to Kyle.
